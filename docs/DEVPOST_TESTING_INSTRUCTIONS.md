WHAT TO TEST (no login first)

1) Career DNA quiz (homepage, no account needed)
Go to https://shyftcut.com and start the “Career DNA” or “Discover your fit” quiz. Answer the questions. You should get a result with a shareable card and optional “Challenge friends” / leaderboard. This uses Gemini 3 for analysis.

2) 90-second Wizard → roadmap (guest or logged in)
From the homepage, start the “Get your roadmap” or Wizard flow. Complete the 5 steps (current role, target career, platforms, hours, etc.). Submit. You should hear a success sound and see a 12-week roadmap with weekly goals and real course links (Udemy, Coursera, YouTube, etc.). If you are not logged in, you may be prompted to sign up to save it. With the premium account above you can create and keep multiple roadmaps.

3) Dashboard and roadmap (after login)
Log in with the premium credentials. Open Dashboard. You should see your roadmaps. Open one. You should see 12 weeks, each with skills, deliverables, and course links that open real course pages. Try marking a week complete and adding notes or tasks.

4) AI Career Coach (Chat) — Premium
From the dashboard or main nav, open “Chat” or “AI Coach”. Send a message (e.g. “How do I stay motivated in week 5?”). You should get a streaming reply from Gemini 3. If there is an “Use web search” or similar option, turn it on and ask something current (e.g. “What are the top skills for product managers in 2025?”) to see grounded answers.

5) Quizzes — Premium
Inside a roadmap or from the study/dashboard area, open “Quiz” or “Generate quiz”. Request a quiz for the current week. You should get multiple-choice questions generated by Gemini 3 (function calling). Answer and check results.

6) CV Analysis — Premium
From the dashboard or profile, find “CV Analysis” or “Analyze my CV”. Paste a short CV or resume text and submit. You should get strengths, gaps, and recommendations from Gemini 3.

7) Job recommendations — Premium
Find “Jobs” or “Find jobs”. Enter your target role or skills and run the search. You should get a list of real job suggestions (Gemini 3 + Google Search grounding). You can save some to a list.

8) AI Avatar — Premium
In Profile or account settings, find “Avatar” or “Generate avatar”. Generate a professional avatar (limit 3 per month on Premium). You should get an image from Gemini 3 Pro Image.
